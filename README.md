# Hippocampus Volume & PTSD Trajectories

**Aim:** To document initial volume differences, as well as volumetric changes, in both the hippocampus and the amygdala during the first 14-months post-trauma, and to evaluate the association between such changes and PTSD symptom trajectories (i.e., persistent PTSD vs. remitting symptoms).
